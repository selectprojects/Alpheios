		V). Thus, according to the express testimony of Cicero (Or. 48, 160),
		Ennius always wrote Burrus for Pyrrhus, and Bruges for Phryges; and so
		the words which were identical in Greek and Latin in the oldest period
		of the language have either preserved <sense id="n51504.0" n="I" level="1"><hi rend="ital">u</hi> where the Greek has <foreign lang="greek">υ</foreign>, as bucina and <foreign lang="greek">βυκάνη</foreign>, cubus and <foreign lang="greek">κύβος</foreign>, fuga and <foreign lang="greek">φυγή</foreign>,
			mus and <foreign lang="greek">μῦς</foreign> et saep.; or this <hi rend="ital">u</hi> has given place to <hi rend="ital">i</hi>, as
			in lacrima, formerly lacruma, = <foreign lang="greek">δάκρυμα</foreign>. Sometimes, also, <hi rend="ital">o</hi> took
			the place of the <foreign lang="greek">υ</foreign>; cf. mola and
				<foreign lang="greek">μύλη</foreign>, sorex and <foreign lang="greek">ὕραξ</foreign>, folium and <foreign lang="greek">φύλλον</foreign>, and, shortening a long vowel,
			ancŏra and <foreign lang="greek">ἄγκυρα</foreign>, like
			lacrĭma and <foreign lang="greek">δάκρῦμα</foreign>. In
			Cicero's time <hi rend="ital">y</hi> seems to have been already in
			use; but its application was restricted to foreign words, and hence
			the spellings Sylla, Tybris, pyrum, satyra, etc., are to be
			rejected. <cb n="Z."/></sense></entryFree></div0></body></text></TEI.2>

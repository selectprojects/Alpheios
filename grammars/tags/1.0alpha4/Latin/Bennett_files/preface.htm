    <h3>PREFACE.</h3>

    <p>The present work is a revision of that published in 1908. No radical alterations have been
      introduced, although a number of minor changes will be noted. I have added an Introduction on
      the origin and development of the Latin language, which it is hoped will prove interesting and
      instructive to the more ambitious pupil. At the end of the book will be found an Index to the
      Sources of the Illustrative Examples cited in the Syntax.</p>

    <h3>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</h3>

    <p>The present book is a revision of my <i>Latin Grammar</i> originally published in 1895.
      Wherever greater accuracy or precision of statement seemed possible, I have endeavored to
      secure this. The rules for syllable division have been changed and made to conform to the
      prevailing practice of the Romans themselves. In the Perfect Subjunctive Active, the endings
        <i>-&#299;s</i>, <i>-&#299;mus</i>, <i>-&#299;tis</i> are now marked long. The
      theory of vowel length before the suffixes <b>-gnus</b>, <b>-gna</b>, <b>-gnum</b>, and also
      before <b>j</b>, has been discarded. In the Syntax I have recognized a special category of
      Ablative of Association, and have abandoned the original doctrine as to the force of tenses in
      the Prohibitive.</p>

    <p>Apart from the foregoing, only minor and unessential modifications have been introduced. In
      its main lines the work remains unchanged.</p>

    <h3>FROM THE PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.</h3>

    <p>The object of this book is to present <i>the essential facts</i> of Latin grammar in a direct
      and simple manner, and within the smallest compass consistent with scholarly standards. While
      intended primarily for the secondary school, it has not neglected the needs of the college
      student, and aims to furnish such grammatical information as is ordinarily required in
      undergraduate courses.</p>

    <p>The experience of foreign educators in recent years has tended to restrict the size of
      school-grammars of Latin, and has demanded an incorporation of the main principles of the
      language in compact manuals of 250 pages. Within the past decade, several grammars of this
      scope have appeared abroad which have amply met the most exacting demands.</p>

    <p>The publication in this country of a grammar of similar plan and scope seems fully justified
      at the present time, as all recent editions of classic texts summarize in introductions the
      special idioms of grammar and style peculiar to individual authors. This makes it feasible to
      dispense with the enumeration of many <i>minutiae</i> of usage which would otherwise demand
      consideration in a student's grammar.</p>

    <p>In the chapter on Prosody, I have designedly omitted all special treatment of the lyric
      metres of Horace and Catullus, as well as of the measures of the comic poets. Our standard
      editions of these authors all give such thorough consideration to versification that
      repetition in a separate place seems superfluous.</p>

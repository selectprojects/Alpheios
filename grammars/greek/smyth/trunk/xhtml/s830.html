          <p>To determine the root all suffixes must be removed from the stem until only
            that part remains which contains the fundamental idea. </p>
          <p><b>a.</b> Most roots are noun-roots or
            verb-roots; but originally a root was neither noun or verb (<a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.2_div2.1.html#s193" title="">193</a>). Some roots are pronominal, and express
            direction or position. Greek has many words whose roots cannot be discovered. The form
            of a root in Greek is not necessarily that which Comparative Grammar shows was common to
            the cognate languages. </p>
          <p><b>b.</b> Since the origin of many words,
            even with the help of the cognate languages, is uncertain, we are often at a loss where
            to make the dividing line between root and suffix. Suffixes are often preceded by a
            vowel which may be regarded as a part of the suffix or as an expansion of the root (by
            some scholars regarded as a part of the root itself). </p>

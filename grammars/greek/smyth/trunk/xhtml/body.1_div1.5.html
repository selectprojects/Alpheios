        <p>THIS List in general includes the common verbs showing any formal peculiarity
          of tense. The forms printed in heavy-faced type belong to standard Attic, that is, to the
          language used in common speech and in ordinary prose; others are poetical, doubtful,
          dialectal or late. Many regular forms are omitted because they do not appear in the
          classical writers; though their non-appearance in the extant texts may often be
          accidental. Later forms are usually excluded, but reference is made to Aristotle, and to
          Hippocrates, though many works ascribed to him are of later date. The determination of the
          forms of Attic prose as distinguished from those of poetry is often difficult because of
          insufficient evidence, and in many cases certainty is not to be attained. The tenses
          employed in the dialogue parts of Aristophanes and other early writers of Attic comedy are
          usually to be regarded as existing in the spoken language except when the character of the
          verb in question is such as to indicate borrowing from Epic or tragedy. Sometimes a tense
          attested only in tragedy and in Attic prose of the latter part of the fourth century may
          have been used in the best Attic prose. The expression <span class="mentioned">in
            prose</span> means <span class="gloss">in Attic prose</span>. </p>
        <p>A prefixed hyphen indicates that a form used in prose is attested generally,
          or only, in composition; and that a poetical form occurs only in composition. Rigid
          consistency would have led to too great detail; besides, many tenses cited as existing
          only in composition may have occurred also in the simple form. For the details of usage on
          this and other points the student is referred to Veitch, <span class="titlem">Greek
            Verbs, Irregular and Defective</span>, and to Kühner-Blass, <span class="titlem">Griechische Grammatik</span>. </p>
        <p>The tenses cited are those of the <span class="term">principal parts</span>
            (<a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.2_div2.9.html#s369" title="">369</a>). Tenses inferred from these
          are omitted, but mention is made of the future perfect, future passive, and of the future
          middle when it shows a passive sense. </p>
        <p>An assumed form is marked by * or has no accent; the abbreviations <span class="mentioned">aor.</span> and <span class="mentioned">perf.</span> denote <span class="gloss">first aorist</span> and <span class="gloss">first perfect</span>; of alternative forms in <span class="foreign">ττ</span> or <span class="foreign">σς</span>
            (<a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.1_div2.3.html#s78" title="">78</a>), that in <span class="foreign">ττ</span> is given when the verb in question belongs to the
          classical spoken language. In the citation of Epic forms, futures and aorists with
            <span class="foreign">σς</span>, and several other Epic
          peculiarities, are usually not mentioned. </p>
        <p>The appended Roman numerals indicate the class (<a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.2_div2.10.html#s497" title="">497</a>-<a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.2_div2.10.html#s529" title="">529</a>) to which the present system of each verb belongs; all verbs not so designated
          belong to the <em>first</em> class (<a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.2_div2.10.html#s498" title="">498</a>-<a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.2_div2.10.html#s504" title="">504</a>). </p>
        <p>At the end of an item, "LSJ" marks a link to the verb's definition in the
          Greek-English Lexicon. </p>

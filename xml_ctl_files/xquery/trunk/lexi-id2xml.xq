  XQuery to retrieve lexicon entries by id

  Form of request is:
    .../lexi-lemma2html.xq?lg=<>&lx=<>&n=<>[&n=<>...]
  where
    lg is the language of the lemma
    lx is the code for the lexicon to use
    n is the if an entry to retrieve.  Multiple ids may be specified.

  Output is returned as XML.

  Possible error messages, as plain text, are:
    "No id specified" if no n parameters were supplied
    "No entries found" if none of the ids was valid
  Other than the message if no ids were valid, invalid ids are
  silently ignored.

  There is no guarantee that the output will be returned in the same
  order as the id in the request.

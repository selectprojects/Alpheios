(:
  Extract treebank sentence and convert it to SVG

  Output is returned as a tree in SVG format with nodes corresponding to words
  in the sentence and arcs corresponding to dependency relations between words.
  There is a synthetic root node, with all words not dependent on any other
  in the sentence as its immediate children.

  At each level, the immediate children of a node are those that correspond to
  words dependent on that node's word.

  Associated with each text node is a line to connect that node to its parent
  and a text label for that line containing the dependency relation between the
  two words.

  Each text element corresponding to a word in the sentence has a class
  attribute whose value is the part of speech of the word.

  It is the responsibility of the caller to position the text and lines for
  display.
